Hello, I'm Jinpeng Chen (陈锦芃), a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Computer Science Department at City University of Hong Kong. My advisors are [Prof. Sam Kwong](https://www.ln.edu.hk/po/professor-sam-kwong-tak-wu) (IEEE Fellow), [Prof. Horace Ho Shing Ip](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/cship.htm), and [Prof. Runmin Cong](https://rmcong.github.io). My research focuses on continual learning, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and image segmentation.
